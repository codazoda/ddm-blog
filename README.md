You can start with a better title than `untitled.md` or you can rename your post to something like `my-post-title.md` later.

### Preview Your Post

Once you've started writing you can preview your post locally in the browser. Here's how.

  - Run a preview server locally: `./hugo server -D`
  - View it in your browser at http://localhost:1313

### Publish your Post

When you're ready to publish your new post, create a pull request.

  - Rename your post: `mv posts/untitled.md posts/my-title.md`
  - Create a branch: `git checkout -b my-title`
  - Commit your changes: `git commit`
